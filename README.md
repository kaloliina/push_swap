# push_swap

## Project Overview

Push Swap is a project that involves sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal of this project was to understand and implement an efficient sorting algorithm that minimizes the number of operations required to sort the stack.

## My Approach

Initially, I felt quite overwhelmed by the project's complexity. However, after watching a helpful YouTube video by a 42 student explaining the push_swap program, I gained a better understanding. I began by studying linked lists and implementing the basic operations, such as populating a list. Once I felt comfortable with these concepts, I delved into the sorting algorithm and broke down the task into smaller, manageable parts. This included checking if the stack was already sorted, sorting small sets of numbers, and eventually building the full sorting logic.

## Learnings

- Structs: Push Swap was my introduction using structs in C, which allowed me to organize data in a structured way. This was a great learning opportunity as I learned how to define and manipulate structs. Most importantly, it made me realise how useful of a tool struct will be in future projects!

- Linked Lists: I also gained experience with linked lists, learning how to create, manipulate, and traverse them efficiently. This was crucial for handling the stack operations in the project.

- Algorithmic Logic: I also learned about the logic behind different sorting algorithms and how to translate that logic into code.

## Future Directions

Overall, I am quite pleased with this project. I tried to put a lot of extra care into dividing the code into understandable sections. The code does look overwhelming at times, but so far I couldn't find a way how to make the code look even cleaner. I'm also quite happy with the number of operations I ended up having when sorting the stack (although this is no thanks to me as I was just following the rules of the Turk Algorithm! ^^)

## How to Run the Project

- Setup Instructions: To use my Push Swap implementation, clone the repository and compile the source files using the provided Makefile.

- Usage Examples: Run the program with a series of integers as arguments.
